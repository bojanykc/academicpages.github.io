I am an assistant professor with the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at the Idaho State University. I received my Ph.D. degree from the University of Florida in 2022 and B.S. degree from the University of Science and Technology of China in 2015.

My research interest focuses on the security and privacy of cyber-physical systems, including smart grid and connected vehicles. The applied methodologies include optimization, control, statistics and machine learning, system implementation, etc.

I am looking for self-motivated Master or PhD students who are interested in security and privacy of cyber-physical systems. Full financial support in the form of research assistantship (RA) or teaching assistantship (TA) will be offered for qualified students. If interested, please send me your CV, transcript(s), and sample publications if any. Please refer to this link for the GRE/TOEFL requirements and other application-related information.
